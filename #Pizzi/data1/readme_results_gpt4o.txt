### Interpretation of the Plots

#### Plot 1: PCA Biplot with Group Distinction

![PCA Biplot](sandbox:/mnt/data/Screen%20Shot%202024-07-24%20at%2012.53.28%20PM.png)

- **Axes**: The plot displays the first two principal components, PC1 (explaining 52.94% of the variance) and PC2 (explaining 30.20% of the variance), accounting for a total of 83.14% of the variance in the data.
- **Data Points**: Each point represents a region of interest (ROI) in the brain vasculature.
- **Color Coding**: Red text denotes control group ROIs, and black text denotes experimental group ROIs. This distinction was added post hoc for visualization and interpretation.
- **Distribution**: The control and experimental groups show overlapping distributions along both PC1 and PC2, indicating that the principal components do not strongly separate the two groups.

#### Plot 2: Correlation of PC1 with Original Variables

![Correlation of PC1](sandbox:/mnt/data/Screen%20Shot%202024-07-24%20at%2012.53.14%20PM.png)

- **Subplots**: Each subplot shows the relationship between PC1 and an original variable.
  - **Left Subplot**: PC1 vs. Zmicrons, showing a strong positive correlation (ρ = 0.822, p ≈ 1.04e-64).
  - **Middle Subplot**: PC1 vs. mean_FWHM_ums, showing a moderate positive correlation (ρ = 0.470, p ≈ 1.32e-15).
  - **Right Subplot**: PC1 vs. FeFv, showing a strong positive correlation (ρ = 0.832, p ≈ 9.13e-68).
- **Regression Lines**: The red lines indicate the linear fit, with shaded regions representing confidence intervals. The strong correlations in the left and right subplots suggest that Zmicrons and FeFv are heavily influencing PC1.

### Statistical Results

The statistical tests comparing the PC scores between the control and experimental groups provided the following results:

1. **PC1:**
   - **Test**: Mann-Whitney U test
   - **Statistic**: 7534.0
   - **p-value**: 0.422
   - **Interpretation**: The p-value is high (greater than 0.05), indicating no significant difference in PC1 scores between the control and experimental groups.

2. **PC2:**
   - **Test**: Mann-Whitney U test
   - **Statistic**: 6909.0
   - **p-value**: 0.062
   - **Interpretation**: The p-value is close to the threshold of 0.05, suggesting a marginal difference in PC2 scores between the groups, but not statistically significant at the conventional 0.05 level.

3. **PC3:**
   - **Test**: t-test
   - **Statistic**: 0.737
   - **p-value**: 0.462
   - **Interpretation**: The p-value is high, indicating no significant difference in PC3 scores between the control and experimental groups.

### Synthesis of Results

- **PCA Summary**: The first two principal components together explain a substantial portion (83.14%) of the variance in the data, which is a good indication that these components capture the key variations.
- **Group Differences**: The statistical analysis shows no significant differences between the control and experimental groups for PC1 and PC3. PC2 shows a marginal difference, but it is not statistically significant at the 0.05 level.
- **Variable Influence**: The strong correlations between PC1 and the original variables Zmicrons and FeFv suggest that these variables are major contributors to the variance captured by PC1. Mean_FWHM_ums also contributes but to a lesser extent.

### Conclusion

The PCA analysis, when visualized with group distinctions, shows no significant separation between control and experimental groups in the principal components. The original variables Zmicrons and FeFv are strongly associated with the primary source of variance (PC1) in the dataset. Further investigation may involve exploring other principal components or additional variables to better understand the subtle differences between the groups.

### Likely Contribution to PC2

To determine whether PC2 is more likely to be influenced by Zmicrons (cortical depth) or FeFv (measure of vessel leakage), we would ideally look at the loadings of the original variables on PC2. The loadings tell us how much each original variable contributes to each principal component. Without this information explicitly provided, we can make educated guesses based on the overall variance explained by the variables:

- **Zmicrons** (cortical depth): If cortical depth varies significantly across your data, it might explain a substantial amount of variance, potentially contributing to PC2.
- **FeFv** (measure of vessel leakage): If vessel leakage varies independently of cortical depth, it might also contribute significantly to another principal component like PC2.

Given that PC1 already shows a strong correlation with FeFv, it is possible that Zmicrons could contribute more to PC2. However, this hypothesis should be confirmed with the actual loadings from the PCA analysis.

### Including Additional Data and Coordinates

Including additional data such as X, Y coordinates and time-series statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum) at each Z-step can indeed enhance the sensitivity and power of your analysis. Here's how this could help:

1. **Spatial Information**:
   - X, Y coordinates provide spatial context, helping to differentiate regions based on location. This could uncover spatial patterns and interactions not visible when only considering Z (depth).

2. **Time-Series Statistics**:
   - Including mean, standard deviation, min, and max for each metric's time series can capture temporal dynamics and variability. These statistics can provide a more comprehensive view of the data's behavior over time.
   - For example, high variability in vessel leakage over time (standard deviation) might indicate unstable or abnormal regions, which could be crucial for distinguishing between control and experimental groups.

### Using PC Scores for Clustering

Using the PC scores for clustering is a valid and often useful approach. Since PCA reduces the dimensionality of the data while retaining most of the variance, the PC scores can be effective inputs for clustering algorithms like K-means or UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection).

1. **K-means Clustering**:
   - The PC scores can be fed into K-means to cluster the data based on the principal components. This can help in identifying subgroups within the data that share similar patterns in the principal component space.

2. **UMAP**:
   - UMAP can be used to further reduce the dimensionality and visualize the data in 2D or 3D while preserving the local and global structure. Clustering on UMAP embeddings can reveal patterns and groupings that might not be apparent in the raw data or PCA alone.

### Next Steps

To implement these suggestions, you can follow these steps:

1. **Compute PCA Loadings**:
   - Obtain the PCA loadings to understand which variables contribute most to PC2 and other components.

2. **Augment Data**:
   - Include X, Y coordinates and time-series statistics for each metric. Ensure that the data is properly scaled and normalized.

3. **Run PCA Again**:
   - Perform PCA on the augmented dataset to see if the additional information improves the separation between groups and the overall variance explained.

4. **Clustering**:
   - Use the PC scores as input for clustering algorithms like K-means or UMAP.
   - Evaluate the clustering results to see if distinct groups emerge that correspond to control and experimental groups.

Here’s a brief overview of how you might augment the data and re-run PCA:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import umap

# Assume 'data' is your original dataframe
# Add X, Y coordinates
data['X'] = x_coords
data['Y'] = y_coords

# Calculate time-series statistics for each metric at each Z-step
metrics = ['metric1', 'metric2', 'metric3']  # Replace with your actual metric names
for metric in metrics:
    data[f'{metric}_mean'] = data[metric].apply(np.mean, axis=1)
    data[f'{metric}_std'] = data[metric].apply(np.std, axis=1)
    data[f'{metric}_min'] = data[metric].apply(np.min, axis=1)
    data[f'{metric}_max'] = data[metric].apply(np.max, axis=1)

# Standardize the augmented data
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data)

# Perform PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=3)
pca_results = pca.fit_transform(scaled_data)
explained_variance = pca.explained_variance_ratio_

# Convert PCA results to a DataFrame
pca_df = pd.DataFrame(pca_results, columns=[f'PC{i+1}' for i in range(3)], index=data.index)

# Run K-means clustering on PC scores
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=2)
data['Cluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(pca_df)

# Run UMAP for visualization
umap_model = umap.UMAP(n_components=2)
umap_results = umap_model.fit_transform(pca_df)
umap_df = pd.DataFrame(umap_results, columns=['UMAP1', 'UMAP2'], index=data.index)
```

By following these steps, you should be able to enhance your analysis and potentially uncover more significant patterns and group differences in your data.

Including the grouping variable directly in the PCA analysis is not standard practice and typically doesn't enhance the power of the PCA itself. PCA is designed to find the directions of maximum variance in the data without any regard to group labels or outcomes. Including the grouping variable in PCA would not yield meaningful components since PCA is about capturing variance in the predictor space, not incorporating known group distinctions.

However, there are alternative approaches where the group information can enhance the analysis:

### 1. **Separate PCAs for Each Group**:
   Performing PCA separately for each group can help understand the variance structure within each group independently. This way, you can compare the variance explained by the components within each group.

### 2. **Supervised PCA**:
   There are supervised dimension reduction techniques, such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), which do take group labels into account. LDA finds the linear combinations of the features that best separate the classes.

### 3. **Including Group Information in Post-PCA Analysis**:
   Although the grouping variable should not be included in the PCA itself, it can be very useful in the subsequent analysis. For example:
   - **Visualization**: After performing PCA, use the group labels to color-code the points in the PCA scatter plot. This helps visually assess if the groups separate along the principal components.
   - **Statistical Tests**: Use the group labels to perform statistical tests on the principal component scores to see if there are significant differences between the groups.
   - **Clustering**: Use the PCA scores for clustering and then assess the cluster compositions with respect to the group labels.

### Practical Steps:

1. **Perform PCA without Grouping Variable**:
   Perform PCA on your data without including the grouping variable.

2. **Use Group Labels in Analysis**:
   Use the group labels to color-code PCA plots, perform statistical tests on PC scores, and conduct clustering analysis.

Here’s a brief summary of the process:

1. **Perform PCA on the Data (without Grouping Variable)**:
   ```python
   from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
   from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

   # Standardize the data
   scaler = StandardScaler()
   scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data.drop(columns=['Group']))

   # Perform PCA
   pca = PCA(n_components=3)
   pca_results = pca.fit_transform(scaled_data)
   explained_variance = pca.explained_variance_ratio_

   # Convert PCA results to DataFrame
   pca_df = pd.DataFrame(pca_results, columns=[f'PC{i+1}' for i in range(3)], index=data.index)
   ```

2. **Visualize PCA with Group Labels**:
   ```python
   import seaborn as sns
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   # Add group labels to PCA DataFrame
   pca_df['Group'] = data['Group']

   # Plot PCA results
   plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
   sns.scatterplot(x='PC1', y='PC2', hue='Group', data=pca_df, palette={'Control': 'red', 'Experimental': 'black'})
   plt.title('PCA of Neuroscience Data')
   plt.xlabel(f'PC1 ({explained_variance[0]:.2%} variance)')
   plt.ylabel(f'PC2 ({explained_variance[1]:.2%} variance)')
   plt.grid(True)
   plt.show()
   ```

3. **Statistical Tests on PC Scores**:
   ```python
   from scipy.stats import mannwhitneyu, ttest_ind

   # Mann-Whitney U Test for PC1 and PC2
   group_control = pca_df[pca_df['Group'] == 'Control']
   group_experimental = pca_df[pca_df['Group'] == 'Experimental']

   stat, p = mannwhitneyu(group_control['PC1'], group_experimental['PC1'])
   print(f'PC1: Mann-Whitney U test statistic = {stat}, p-value = {p}')

   stat, p = mannwhitneyu(group_control['PC2'], group_experimental['PC2'])
   print(f'PC2: Mann-Whitney U test statistic = {stat}, p-value = {p}')

   # T-test for PC3
   stat, p = ttest_ind(group_control['PC3'], group_experimental['PC3'])
   print(f'PC3: T-test statistic = {stat}, p-value = {p}')
   ```

4. **Clustering with PCA Scores**:
   ```python
   from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

   # Run K-means clustering on PC scores
   kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=2)
   pca_df['Cluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(pca_df[['PC1', 'PC2', 'PC3']])

   # Compare cluster composition with group labels
   sns.scatterplot(x='PC1', y='PC2', hue='Cluster', data=pca_df, palette='viridis')
   plt.title('K-means Clustering on PCA Results')
   plt.xlabel(f'PC1 ({explained_variance[0]:.2%} variance)')
   plt.ylabel(f'PC2 ({explained_variance[1]:.2%} variance)')
   plt.grid(True)
   plt.show()
   ```

### Summary
- **PCA**: Perform without group labels.
- **Group Labels**: Use in visualization, post-PCA statistical tests, and clustering analysis.
- **Enhanced Analysis**: Including additional spatial and temporal data can improve PCA's effectiveness in distinguishing groups.

Implementing these steps should help you better understand the group differences and potentially uncover significant patterns in your data.
